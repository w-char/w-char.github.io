## Home Credit Default Project

### Business Problem
Home Credit strives for financial inclusion among those who are struggling to get a loan. They are looking for a more reliable way to identify customers that are able to make repayments in order to lessen defaults. In addition to losses from defaulting, rejecting clients who are likely to repay their loan also leads to lost revenue, and finding new clients is costly. The purpose of this project is to generate a default risk model that can maximize assessment accuracy using a variety of alternative data for this project. This will result in having more approved loans with controlled risk, less defaults, improved profitability, and improved financial opportunities for customers struggling with the traditional credit system.

### Project Takeaways and Reflection

From the technical aspect of the project, I learned a lot about data preparation and modeling through this project. When I worked on the modeling assignment I recognized that there may have been some data leakage that I only noticed later in hindsight. I had little experience in data preparation and modeling previously so there was a bit of a steep learning curve but this project helped me understand the data process and good data practices better. I also lacked experience in github but this project forced me to get more familiar with using github so that we could work effectively as a team, and I believe that it was a huge improvement for my personal progress.

In regards to teamwork, I believe that we worked effectively for the most part but something I learned is that when relying on others for teamwork, it is best to be more ahead of schedule than you would normally think is necessary. There are often conflicts in schedule between multiple people and being ahead of schedule made it possible for us to implement plan b's and c's if someone was not able to finish their delegated tasks. I think that the way in which we assigned tasks was very efficient, and I learned a lot about the data preparation and modeling process from my groupmates during the modeling portion of the project.
